# CUNEF Machine Learning Course

Welcome to the Machine Learning course repository for CUNEF Universidad Students.

## About This Course

This repository contains hands-on exercises and tutorials designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming, data analysis, and machine learning. The course is structured in three main parts, progressively building from basic Python programming to implementing machine learning algorithms.


## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Write Python code for data manipulation and analysis
- Process and clean real-world datasets
- Visualize data to extract insights
- Implement and evaluate machine learning algorithms
- Apply ML techniques to business problems

## Course Structure

The course is divided into three main parts:

### Part 1: Fundamentals
Introduction to Python programming, NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

### Part 2: Data Processing
Techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis and machine learning.

### Part 3: Machine Learning Implementations
Hands-on implementation of various ML algorithms including decision trees, regression models, and more.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)

The easiest way to get started is using Google Colab, which requires no installation:

1. Click on any "Open in Colab" badge above
2. The notebook will open in Google Colab
3. Click "Copy to Drive" to save your own copy
4. Start coding!

**Advantages:**
- No setup required
- Runs in the cloud
- Free GPU access
- Automatic saving to Google Drive

### Option 2: Local Installation

If you prefer to run the notebooks locally:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sabalanya/CUNEF-Machine-Learning.git
   cd CUNEF-Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Install Anaconda or Miniconda:**
   - Download from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n cunef-ml python=3.11
   conda activate cunef-ml
   ```

4. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
   ```

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. **Navigate to the desired notebook and start learning!**
